# Ruby Hangman Project

## Project Overview
Welcome to the "Ruby Hangman" project, part of the Ruby programming curriculum from The Odin Project. This project is designed to challenge and enhance my Ruby programming skills through the development of a command-line Hangman game. The game involves a player guessing letters to figure out a hidden word, selected randomly from a provided dictionary.

This project focuses on several key programming concepts, including file manipulation, serialization of objects, and the implementation of game logic in Ruby.

## Key Learning Objectives
Throughout this project, I aim to strengthen several important skills:

- **Ruby Fundamentals**: Enhancing my understanding of Ruby's syntax, data structures, and object-oriented programming principles.
- **File Manipulation**: Learning to manage file input/output operations, particularly with text files.
- **Game Logic Implementation**: Developing the ability to implement complex game logic and manage game state effectively.
- **Serialization**: Understanding and applying serialization techniques to save and load game states.
- **Problem-Solving Skills**: Improving my ability to solve problems and implement features in a structured manner.

## Getting Started
Here's how I plan to approach this project:

1. **Repository Setup**: Initialize a GitHub repository to track the development process and document the project.
2. **Environment Configuration**: Set up the Ruby development environment and prepare any necessary resources, such as the dictionary file.
3. **Incremental Development**: Build the game in phases, starting with basic word selection, then adding guessing mechanics, followed by implementing save/load functionality.
4. **Testing & Debugging**: Regularly test each component to ensure the game runs smoothly and debug any issues that arise.
5. **Code Refinement**: Continuously refactor the code to improve readability, maintainability, and performance.

## Conclusion
The "Ruby Hangman" project is an exciting venture into the realm of Ruby programming and game development. It offers a practical application of programming concepts and a chance to develop a fun, interactive command-line game.

I am eager to take on this project, embracing the challenges and learning opportunities it presents. This project is more than just a coding task; it's a valuable step in my journey as a budding software developer.
